# The Amazing Number Machine #

This app takes a number and tells you what it is divisible by; I've made it to practice JS array methods and sharpen my problem-solving skills!

* Code block styling is done with [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com)
* The task runner used is [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com) was used to create the title image
* The background is called "Graph Paper" from [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com)
